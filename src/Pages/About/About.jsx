            <p>Welcome from Xemiron. I am Toufic Ahammed the founder of Xemiron IT Solutions. I will share you the journey of Xemiron and its Journey.</p>

            <p>It everything started on 2017 when I first started my career at as a freelanceer web designer. Back then I used to be a WordPress Expert. I learnt HTML, CSS, little Javascript and PHP. And basically I used to work as a WordPress expert. But as you know WordPress is basically a CMS and you dont have full controll over it unless you are a profeccient programmer.</p>

            <p>So from that point I started thinking about learning a programming language. It took me sometime to finally be it. I learnt Python and then started using itâ€™s framework Django.Everything was moving fine and then suddenly I feel like I can cover more than just programming for my clients since they love working with me. So I started to gathering more experts for different projetcs for my clients and everything was moving well. Then I startend feeling why not my own established brand for this that people will recognise?</p>

            <p>And then the birth of Xemiron.</p>

            <p>And then the birth of Xemiron.</p>

            <p>Alhamdulillah everything is moving smooth since we started. Yes there were ups and downs.</p>
